//! A "hello world" echo server with Tokio
//!
//! This server will create a TCP listener, accept connections in a loop, and
//! write back everything that's read off of each TCP connection.
//!
//! Because the Tokio runtime uses a thread pool, each TCP connection is
//! processed concurrently with all other TCP connections across multiple
//! threads.
//!
//! To see this server in action, you can run this in one terminal:
//!
//!     export CARGO_CFG_HTTPARSE_DISABLE_SIMD=1
//!     make A=apps/std/rosrust-subscriber-node STD=y NET=y ACCEL=n SMP=2 run
//!
//! Each line you type in to the `connect` terminal should be echo'd back to
//! you! If you open up multiple terminals running the `connect` example you
//! should be able to see them all make progress simultaneously.
